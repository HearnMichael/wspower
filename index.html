<h1 id="How-You-Can-Help">About The Cause</h1>
<p>Please help protect the William and Sarah Power Family Cemetery and the surrounding historic site. They are in imminent danger. Through trusts, grants, crowdfunding, we can buy the land from the current property owners, Albert Ashkouti and the Ashkouti family (owners/principals of the development group Heritage Capitol Partners and holding group Tabas Two Lllp). As a public park and protected historic landmark, the site can remain a testament to the Cherokee, Power family, and Georgia history for generations. It would also be an asset to the Ahskoutis' redevelopment of the aging developed land around it and increase land value.
</p>
<p>The cemetery has been vandalized numerous times, but within the past couple years, conditions have exacerbated to the point of a criminal exhumation of one coffin from its grave and the toppling over of all the tombstones. On top of this, the old-growth trees on the adjacent eighteen-acre site, and even the cemetery itself, are under threat of being demolished for development of a massive mixed use complex that will destroy nearly all of the original site. The current plan allocates a small square of land for the cemetery sandwiched between numerous town homes, but the property owners have pushed to move the cemetery itself, virtually destroying it. As many of the descendants who know of the land are aging and immobile, the site will continue to be in danger without securing it as a protected landmark and public park. Divorced from the adjoining eighteen acres of old-growth forest, the cemetery would lose much of its value.

<h1 id="History-of-the-Land">History of the Land</h1>
<p>
        Before the Power Family, the land along with most of North Georgia was part of the great Cherokee Nation. Later, the Power family of Georgia lived for nearly two centuries along the Chattahoochee River in what is now-day Marietta, Vinings, Smyrna, and Sandy Springs. William Power was the son of John Wesley Power, born during the first Potato Famine, who immigrated from Ireland around 1770. The Powers were the first settlers on the land after the forced removal of the local Cherokee to north of the Chattahoochee (but before the relocation of the tribe en masse out west during the Trail of Tears). The family acquired the land through the 1832 lottery. This was during the establishment of Cobb County and before the founding of most cities in the area, including Roswell and Atlanta. The Powers were a prominent local family and part of the genesis of the Atlanta area and Georgia as we know it today. Specifically, James Power, William's brother, built the ferry after which the modern Power’s Ferry Road is named. He along with Hardy Pace and others went on to found the City of Marietta. The Powers and their descendants also married other once-prominent families of Georgia, such as the Venables (former owners of Stone Mountain), Spruills (of the Spruill House in Dunwoody), Glovers of Cumming, and Morgans (namesake of the Morgan Falls Dam and Reservoir). The site is not only valuable as a historic landmark of the Power family, but also a significant nature preserve with dozens of trees that are a hundred or more years old. The untouched land of the adjacent eighteen acres is one of only a few old-growth forests remaining untouched from the time of the Cherokee. It has survived two centuries thus far, with our help it will continue.

        The entire site including the cemetery and adjoining eighteen acres qualifies for historic landmark status, and I am doing as much work as possible to see it declared a landmark and protected. Currently, the undeveloped eighteen adjacent to the cemetery is under threat of development and the owner has even expressed a desire to remove the cemetery itself. He has expressed doing so within the next six months. As one of the few remaining old-growth forests in the area, as well as a burial site for historically significant persons, this would be an affront to the history and posterity of the Atlanta area and Georgia.

        This campaign is not only to save the site and rehabilitate the cemetery but also to establish a community park and nature preserve on all nineteen acres. According to research, pedestrian traffic, beautification, lighting, and maintenance of a cemetery are the best recourse against vandalism. Moreover, a community park creates a connection between cultural and practical value. The park would have nature trails, a lawn, dog park, lighting, native landscaping, new fences for the cemetery, and access points to Roswell Road and the surrounding developments. Volunteers have already started a master plan, but the legal status and protection of the land is first priority.
